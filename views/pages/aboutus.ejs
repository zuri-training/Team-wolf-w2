      <h3 class="text-head">Our Mission</h3>
      <p class="text-p">
        WordPress is software designed for everyone, emphasizing accessibility,
        performance, security, and ease of use. We believe great software should
        work with minimum set up, so you can focus on sharing your story,
        product, or services freely. The basic WordPress software is simple and
        predictable so you can easily get started. It also offers powerful
        features for growth and success.

      <p class="text-p">
        Supporting this idea is a large community of people collaborating on and
        contributing to this project. The WordPress community is welcoming and
        inclusive. Our contributors’ passion drives the success of WordPress
        which, in turn, helps you reach your goals.
